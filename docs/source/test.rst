Overview
^^^^^^^^

**se.plan** is a spatially explicit online tool designed to support forest restoration planning decisions by restoration stakeholders. It is part of `SEPAL <https://sepal.io/>`_ (System for Earth Observation Data Access, Processing and Analysis for Land Monitoring), a component of UN FAO’s free, open-source software suite, `Open Foris <http://www.openforis.org>`_. It aims to identify locations where the benefits of forest restoration are high relative to restoration costs, subject to biophysical and socioeconomic constraints that users impose to define the areas where restoration is allowable. The computation is performed using cloud-based supercomputing and geospatial datasets from Google Earth Engine available through SEPAL. As a decision-support tool, it is intended to be used in combination with other information users may have that provides greater detail on planning areas and features of those areas that **se.plan** might not adequately include. It offers users the option to replace its built-in data layers, which are based on publicly available global datasets, with users’ own customized layers. Please see :ref:`Appendix A` for a list of **se.plan**’s built-in data layers and their sources.

The sections below highlight key features of **se.plan**. A high-level view of using the tool can be described as follows:
