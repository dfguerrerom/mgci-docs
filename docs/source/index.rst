SDG 15.4.2 Computation Tools Documentation
=========================================


Welcome to the technical documentation of SDG Indicator 15.4.2 computation tools. These tools support the use of earth observation data to monitor progress on the two sub-indicators under SDG 15.4.2: namely Sub-Indicator 15.4.2a: Mountain Green Cover Index, and Sub-Indicator 15.4.2b: Proportion of degraded mountain land. 

The tools, based on QGIS software and SEPAL (System for Earth Observation Data Access, Processing and Analysis for Land Monitoring), have been designed to support countries in analyzing data to prepare their reporting commitments to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The tools are the result of a collaboration between FAO and the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC). 

This guide provides an overall introduction to SDG Indicator 15.4.2, its data requirements, and detailed step-by-step instructions to set up and run the tools.
